//  ToDo: why does post redirect to feed, compress images, add location to blip post, get the image URL (poke around Ubuntu?)
//  ISSUE: insecure text data transfer, not using blipdropper.com
//  ISSUE: need to request access to camera roll and enable camera
//  ISSUE: need to convert to VC with tableview vs. custom TableViewVC because floating button will break
